Devops ==> Linux 
Hadoop ==> Linux 
Tester ==> Linux 
Developer ==> Linux 
PL/SQL, Oracle DBA ==> Linux 
90% of real time application ==> Linux platform

What is UNIX ?
--------------
It is an operating system created in 1960s. 
With lot of extension and improvement to base version, several flavors introduced by organization/companies (RedHat Linux, Ubuntu, Suse, PopOs!….) 

Chracteristics of UNIX ===>
---------------------------
1. It is Freeware 
2. It is Open source software 
3. It is FOSS ( Freeware and Open source software) 
4. It is multi user operating system 
5. It is multi tasking operating system 
6. It is user friendly and supports both cui based and gui based 
    CUI ->  Character User Interface 
    GUI -> Graphical User Interface  

Dir1 Dir2 Dir3 Dir4 ….................... Dir50              
In the directory we wanna create 100 files in every dir 
File1 File2 File3 File4 ….. File100 

CMD : mkdir dir{1..50}
touch dir{1..50}/file{1..100}

7. It is more secure than windows operating system


Flavours of UNIX :
------------------
As UNIX is open source operating system, multiple flavours are available with lot of extension and improvements.

Ubuntu
RedHat Linux
CentOS
Fedora
Slackware
Open Solaries
Kali
Suse Linux Enterprise Server(SLES)
Open Suse
PopOs!

Components of UNIX:
-------------------
2 inportant Components :
                    * Shell
                    * Kernel

1. Shell :
----------
. It is a outer layer of UNIX operating system.
. Shell reads command provided by user.
. Shell will check is it valid command or not.
. Shell will check it is properly userd or not.
. If everything is proper, then shell interprets/converts that command into kernel understandable form and handover that to the kernel. 
. Shell acts as interface between user and kernel.

2. Kernel :
-----------
. It is the core component of unix operating system.
. It is responsible to execute our command with the help of hardware components.
. Memory allocation and processor allocation will takes care by kernel.
. It acts as interface between shell and hardware components.

Two type of user are there in  linux => 
---------------------------------------
normal user ===> $prompt
super user/root user /admin user ===> #prompt

sudo -i ===> To switch to superuser

Online UNIX Terminal:
---------------------
http://www.masswerk.at/jsuix


The most commonly used basic commands:
--------------------------------------

1. pwd --> print working directory
2. ls --> list out all files and directory
3. mkdir --> to create/make a directory
4. cd --> change directory
5. touch --> to create a empty file
6. rmdir --> to remove a directory
7. rm --> to remove a file
8. cal --> display current month calandar
9. date --> display current date and time
10. help --> to display list of available command
11. clear --> to clear Terminal
12. exit --> to logout session
13. hello --> to display brief system information
14. cd.. --> go to previous

user home directory for bhavya: /home/bhavya
user home directory for other: /home/other
user home directory for guest: /home/guest



Topic-2: Linux File System:
---------------------------

Types of file in linux:
-----------------------

* In Linux everything is treated as as a file

All Files are Divided into Three Types :-
-----------------------------------------
1. Normal Files or Ordinary Files
2. Directory Files
3. Device Files

1. Normal Files or Ordinary Files:
----------------------------------
These files contain data. It can be normal text file or binary files(images, video, files, audio files etc)

ex. 
abc.txt
test.sh===>Script File
test.py===>Python File
Test.java===>Java File
sunny.jpg
bahubali.mp4

{* 
touch sunny.jpg
gedit sunny.jpg
cat sunny.jpg
file sunny.jpg
*}

* In Linux file extension is not important. based on our content the linux can identify file type.

2. Directory Files:
-------------------
These files represents directories.
In windows, we can use folder terminology but in linux we can use directory terminology.
directory contains files and sub directories also.

3. Device Files:
----------------
In Linux every device is represented as a file.
By using this file we can communicate with that device.
Inside /dev directory all device related file will be there


terminal 1 ===> /dev/pts/0
terminal 2 ===> /dev/pts/1

{* 
tty -> terminal directory
echo "I Love Bhavya" > /dev/pts/1  --> send cmd to second terminal
clear > /dev/pts/1
*}

Note:
crtl+alt+t ===> To open terminal
crtl+d ===> To close the terminal


How to check file type:
-----------------------

In Ubuntu:
blue color files represents: directories
remaining: ordinary file

we have to use ls commnad with -l option

* The first chracter represents the type of the file
d ---> directory file
- ===> ordinary file
l ---> link file

c ---> Chracter special file
b ---> block special File
s ---> Socket file


File System Navigation Commands :
---------------------------------

hidden files and hidden directories

$ ls
$ ls -a(-a mean all)

. ====> represents current directory
.. ===> represents parents directory

/home/bhavya/Desktop/dir1/dir2
if you are in dir2
current directory: dir2
parent directory: dir1
   
cd command

1. $ cd .
        changes to current directory (useless)

2. $ cd..
        changes to parent directory

3. $ cd ../../..

4. $ cd ~
        to go to user home directory
        /home/bhavya

5. $ cd
      cd command without any argument
      to go to user home directory
        /home/bhavya

6. $ cd -
        If we want to go previous working directory


Linux File System Hierarchy :
-----------------------------

Linux file system has TREE like structure.
It starts with root(/)
/ is the topmost directory
sub directories:
bin   etc   home   lib   dev   use   cdrom 

1. bin directory:
-----------------
bin mean binary
It contains all binary executables related to our linux command.

touch
ls
mkdir
cd


$ which cmdname
            check the related file

2. sbin directory:
------------------
sbin means systembin
normal user used command related binary executeable file available in bin directory.

super user used command related binary executeable file available in sbin directory.

Disk partitioning 
Network management

Q. what is the difference between bin and sbin?
bin contains binary executables related to command used by the super user.
sbin contains binary executeables related to commands used by super user. 

3. etc directory:
-----------------
This directory conatins all system configuration files.
These configuration files can be used by operating system itself.

/etc/passwd ===> All user information
/etc/group ===> All groups information
/etc/hosts ===> All hosts information (ip address and dns names)


supppose im in dir2 ... from there if i write cd home what will happen ?
$ cd home (not work)
$ cd /home


4. tmp directory:
-----------------
